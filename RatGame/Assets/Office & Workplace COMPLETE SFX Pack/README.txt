Gaby Bendtsen Sound
--------------------


Hello, and thank you for purchasing my Office and Workplace SFX pack!

My name is Gaby Bendtsen, an audio professional who loves all things sound. Iâ€™ve worked in audio for video game companies, sports, and film, and hope that this pack elevates your game or project. In the emerging era of AI, it becomes more difficult by the day for independent creators to stand out. By purchasing this pack, you contribute to supporting living artists and the work that we do!
